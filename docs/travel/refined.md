# Travel Refined

Refined travel is the closest to the standard rules with a focus on expedience and clarity, while still allowing for travel to be more important.

## Pillars

1. Destination
2. Travel Time
3. Getting Lost
4. Encounters

## Flow

1. Pick one party member to roll a **_Wisdom (Survival)_** check.
2. Apply modifiers from travel pace
3. Consult destination DC table (below)
4. Consult success/fail table for result

### Navigation Results

Compare your Wisdom (Survival) skill check result to the table below and apply all results. If you fail a check and become lost, roll to determine the direction (d8 for squares; d6 for hex) and then a d12 for distance.

| Success By | Result                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| 10+        | Roll on treasure chart            |
| 0-4        | Roll on encounter chart (neutral) |
| 0+         | Find Location                     |

| Failure By | Result                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1-4        | Miss destination by d12 miles     |
| 5-9        | Progress d12 miles                |
| 10-14      | No progress                       |
| 15-19      | Progress backwards d12 miles      |
| 20+        | Existential crisis                |
| 5+         | Roll on encounter chart (hostile) |

\*_for rolls on after becoming lost, roll for direction (d8 for squares; d6 for hex)_

## Explanations

When traveling to a location, set a Navigation DC. One of the party members must make a Wisdom (Survival) skill check against the Navigation DC. Apply modifiers for travel pace (PHB Ch.8). Then check the Navigation Results table and follow all directions that apply. If any party member would automatically succeed after applying modifiers, the party does not make a skill check.

### Getting Lost

The result of your roll directly correlates to the severity of your failed navigation. While landing close to the DC will simply steer you slightly off course a more severe failure will cost you progress or even send you in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, catastrophic failure may result in a party changing encounter. Additionally, all failures greater than 5 will cause a hostile encounter roll in addition to the mentioned detriment.

The distance your party drifts off course caps at 1d12. This amount represents a worst case scenario of 1/2 the distanced traveled in a day at normal pace (24 miles).

### Survival Checks

In addition to the traditional rule that perception checks are rolled with disadvantage during a fast pace (and advantage during slow), the same effect applies to survival checks. While the perception changes represent your (in)ability to avoid ambushes, the effect on survival would be the altered difficulty of noticing your surroundings at difference speeds.
